## DAY1: Introduction to EDA Basics

**Learning Notes**: Next, we are about to formally start learning EDA. Understand the EDA process, what are the purposes and reference indicators of each link. For the project introduction, you can first browse the [iEDA Bilibili video account](https://space.bilibili.com/1189298533). If you have any questions or ideas during the learning process, you can also contact and ask the teachers and students of the relevant projects of iEDA.

**To prevent forgetting after reading**, when reading books, it is recommended to sort out the main EDA process before reading and construct a mind map; then supplement the details during the reading process.
