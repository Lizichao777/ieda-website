## DAY15 - DAY20: iEDA Engineering Code Practice

### 1. Specific Requirements

(1) **For the System Direction**:

- **Overall Goal**: Focus on data flow changes, services provided by the platform, API interfaces of each point tool of iEDA, and logical interactions, etc.
- **Tasks and Requirements**:
  - Task 1: Code Reading and Understanding: Concentrate on code reading and improve the architecture diagram and description in "Draw the architecture diagram of the iEDA project and describe it in words" on the 16th day.
  - Task 2: Follow the module division of the iEDA platform to complete the following functions:
    - Use iEDA to read the gcd design file. According to the EDA back-end design process, run the iEDA point tool processes in sequence. Refer to the output results of the existing point tools and summarize the changes of relevant parameters of each process. Design the corresponding Json data structure to show the parameter changes of each process.
- **Learning Courses**:
  - Refer to iEDA Practice: [System Engineering Practice: S1 - Data Flow Processing and Analysis](/train/practice/systems/s1.md)

(2) **For the Algorithm Direction**:

- **Overall Goal**: Conduct in-depth learning of a certain point tool of the iEDA project, including the iFP and iPL point tools for implementing floorplanning and placement, the iRT point tool for implementing routing, the iSTA point tool for implementing static timing analysis, etc. Be familiar with the data flow changes of the point tool, master the architecture implementation and algorithm implementation of the point tool, and understand the specific methods and interfaces in the point tool.
- **Tasks and Requirements**:
  - Task 1: Code Reading and Understanding: Concentrate on code reading and improve the architecture diagram and description in "Draw the architecture diagram of the iEDA project and describe it in words" on the 16th day.
  - Task 2: Code Design:
    - In this practical assignment, implement the layout legalization module and implement the Tetris algorithm for legalization.

      - **Algorithm Optimization Goal**: The sum of the vertical movement distance of all cells and the future horizontal movement distance is minimized.
    - **The main steps of the Abacus algorithm are as follows** (dynamic programming algorithm, which will move the legalized cells):

      - Cell dispersion to rows: Sort each cell according to the abscissa of the cell. Each time a cell is processed, the cell is first moved to the nearest row;
      - Intra-row legalization: Calculate the cost of the cell in this row, as well as the cost of moving to the upper and lower parts of this row, to ensure that the total movement of the cell is minimal and there is no overlap;
      - Cell placement: Place the cell in the row with the minimum cost, and update the cluster and coordinates simultaneously.
    - **The main steps of the Tetris algorithm are as follows** (greedy algorithm, which will not move the legalized cells):

      - Candidate space selection: Arrange all cells in the order of abscissa and select the leftmost blank area in each row;
      - Cell placement: For each cell, select the nearest one in the candidate space and place it. Update the occupied cell information and place one by one until all cells are placed.
- **Learning Courses**:
  - Refer to iEDA Practice: [Algorithm Design Practice: A1 - Implementation of Layout Legalization Algorithm](/train/practice/algorithms/a1.md)
  - Refer to iEDA Practice: [Algorithm Design Practice: A3 - Incremental Timing Optimization Algorithm](/train/practice/algorithms/a2.md)

### 2. Learning Outcomes Presentation

- Implement the code design in accordance with the coding specification and achieve the corresponding functions as required. Submit a PR to the code repository.
- Output the improved iEDA architecture diagram and its textual description.


### 3. Reference Materials

(1) **Materials**:

- [iEDA User Manual](/tools/ieda-platform/guide.md)
- [Open-Source Chip Design EDA Platform from Netlist to GDS of iEDA](https://gitee.com/oscc-project/iEDA/blob/master/README.md)
- "Paper of Abacus.pdf", "Patent of Tetris.pdf" [Link](https://gitee.com/oscc-project/iTraining/tree/master/EDA/ppt)
"Paper of Abacus.pdf" introduces a new method called "Abacus" for legalizing the layout of standard cell circuits with minimal movement. By sorting cells by position and legalizing them one by one, this method uses dynamic programming when moving cells to reduce the overall movement.
"Patent of Tetris.pdf" introduces a method and system for high-speed detailed placement of cells within an integrated circuit design. By sorting and placing cells, it improves the placement efficiency and achieves a higher-performance integrated circuit design.
