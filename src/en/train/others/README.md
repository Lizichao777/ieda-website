## **Main Introduction**

Currently, the demand for EDA talents still exceeds the supply, and the threshold for EDA and chip design remains high. There is an urgent need for an EDA learning course that enables quick entry. This project aims to create a general training program for comprehensive EDA talents, suitable for the technical stack training of iEDA team interns and the practical courses of EDA in colleges and universities.
