**Introduction to OSEDA Workshop and Community**

We believe that in the future, every chip designer can use open-source design tools (EDA) to design, validate, and manufacture open-source RISC-V chips just as easily as using open-source GNU toolchains to compile C code. To achieve this common goal, active contributors from the RISC-V open-source community and the EDA research field established the OSEDA community, dedicated to developing and promoting open-source EDA technologies and tools in the RISC-V community. The short-term goal of the OSEDA community is to attract over 1,000 developers and over 10,000 developers by 2025 to join the open-source EDA community and contribute to open-source projects.

To foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration between open-source EDA developers and users from around the world, the OSEDA community plans to hold the Third OSEDA Workshop on August 20, 2024, as part of the fourth RISC-V China Summit. This workshop will be held concurrently with the RISC-V China Summit.
