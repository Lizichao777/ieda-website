title: "2023 the CCF-DAC Digital EDA Algorithms and Models Forum"
order: 3
---

| [**Forum 1: Digital EDA Tools, Algorithms, and Models Forum**] |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Date**: October 14, 2023, 13:30 PM - 6:00 PM                         |
| **Sponsored by**: Beijing Institute of Open Source Chips                |
| **Forum Description**: To bridge the gap between industry and academia, an open-source, full-chain EDA development platform is urgently needed to explore new EDA research methodologies and technologies, to train EDA professionals, to synchronize the transfer of problems between industry and academia, and to transfer key technologies from academia to industry. This will form a good product-research-development loop, improving the efficiency and quality of EDA research. Open-source is the best way to provide EDA development platforms to all researchers in various disciplines, and this forum aims to promote the development of a high-quality open-source EDA tool platform and key technologies. |
| **Chair**: **Bao Yungang**, **Institute of Computational Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences** |
| **Co-Chair**: **Li Xingquan**, **Pengcheng Laboratory** |
